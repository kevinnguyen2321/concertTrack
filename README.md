# ConcertTrack

## Introduction

Welcome to ConcertTrack, where tracking concerts just became easier. This app is designed for concert enthusiasts who want to keep a record of all the concerts they've attended, discover new events, and stay connected with the music they love.

## Purpose/Motivation

Tired of going to a ton of concerts? Who am I kiddingâ€”going to concerts is never tiring! Let me rephrase the question: tired of going to tons of concerts and not being able to track how many concerts you attend as a frequent concert-goer? Well, this is the app for you. With ConcertTrack, you can easily keep track of past concerts, add new ones, and organize your experiences in one convenient place.
